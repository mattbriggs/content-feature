Question,"VLSC features are moving to M365 Admin Center (MAC)
",Answer,"<p>Microsoft is transitioning volume licensing capabilities to M365 Admin Center to enable customers to manage on-premises software, on-line services, and subscriptions in one site accessed by a single Log in ID.</p>
<p>From April 2023, we will start retiring VLSC functionality that is already available in M365 Admin Center. Users will be re-redirected to M365 Admin Center - with no need to sign in again.</p>
"
Question,"Will my VLSC Log In ID work for VL experiences in MAC?
",Answer,"<p>Yes, the work or school account (WSA) you use to sign into VLSC should work for M365 Admin Center.</p>
"
Question,"Who can view VL information in M365 Admin Center
",Answer,"<p>To view volume licensing in the M365 Admin Center you must have registered a license ID (volume licensing agreement or enrolment) in the VLSC.</p>
<p>After registering in the VLSC and signing into MAC at least once, it won't be necessary to return to VLSC for those VL features that are present in the MAC.</p>
<div class=""NOTE"">
<p>Note</p>
<p>M356 Admin Center administrators who do not also have VLSC permissions do NOT have access to VL features on MAC.</p>
